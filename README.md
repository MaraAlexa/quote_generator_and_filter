# This project has 2 functionalities

** see the project at:** [ https://maraalexa.github.io/quote_generator_and_filter]( https://maraalexa.github.io/quote_generator_and_filter)
## 1. Random Quote generator
** The quotes used are fetched from an external source**

## 2. Search through the quotes to find the quote wanted
** You can filter the quotes by typing a keyword that you remember or the name of the author**

**This concept demonstrates getting json data from an API and then using ES6 functions to filter the data to a desired result**

**This project uses ES6, so it only works in Chrome.**
To make it work in most browsers you need to change arrow functions into ES5 functions or transpile the code with something like Webpack or Gulp.
